# arch-custom-install
## Presentation
This is a modular script under development that I'm going to use for Arch Linux post-installation. I'm aiming for a scipt that can be adapted to everyone's needs.

## Options in development/available
### Nvidia drivers
Script which install the nvidia drivers for the kernel linux (may be I will implement an option which detect your kernel and install the good driver). Too it adding the modules to the initramfs (normally it's Wayland ready).

### Wrapper

You can choice to install a Wrapper like Paru, Yay or do nothing and stay with Pacman.
